#  EDA Project Proposal

## MTA Maintenance Department - Backstory
The maintenance department within Metropolitan Transportation Authority(MTA) is responsible and accountable for maintenance in subway stations in New York. their duties include fixing elevators, maintaining the turnstiles, and cleaning. 

 Recently, MTA announced that they are facing problems with passengers delays caused by turnstiles and elevators maintenance work during outages. The department asked talented data scientists to use their skills and insights for studying the impact of outages within the NYC subway system and to come up with a data-driven method to prioritize and schedule maintenance in order to minimize delays.

## EDA for Maintenance Department

During the first few weeks of SDAIA Data Science Bootcamp, I've obtained many skills in programming, statistics, and data analytics. I am planning to apply data science methodologies to the available data sources in order to design a solution for the client (MTA Maintenance Department) and help them achieve their main goal which is rescheduling maintenance work to minimize riders delays.

 I intend to work with SQL Database via Python SQLalchemy, EDA in Pandas, and Python visualization libraries and other tools to answer some questions and to come up with interesting insights such as: 
 

 - Understand the impact of elevator outages within the NYC subway system
 - Study the effect of rainy days on train ridership in order to schedule cleaning work.
 - Finding the overall busiest stations.

### Data Sources 

In this project, I intend to use 2020 data from three sources:

 - [MTA turnstile data](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html) : Data about the entries/exists record of turnstiles.
 - [MTA Elevator data](http://web.mta.info/elevator-escalator-status): List of the elevators and their locations at each station.
 - [Weather Underground Website](https://www.wunderground.com/) : Search for the weather for zip code 10027, which is in NYC, and then download the .csv file to obtain the weather at specific date range.
